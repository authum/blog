I found a treasure trove of notes from my attendance at Agile2012 recently on a talk given by Angela Druckman called "The Dirty Dozen - 12 Practices That Can Kill Your Agile Transformation." Here is a recap, it has been a while, so its just some key points:

One of the key points conveyed was that **most problems are symptoms of root causes and those are often value conflicts.** The trouble with transforming your team to use agile methodologies often boil down to how managers and team mates view the nature of work.

##1. Teams that don't self manage.
- Moving "resources" around constantly prevents the team from really gelling and fostering the relationships necessary to self manage.
- People are people, not resources, not bags of sand. You can't just plug one into another team and expect performance.

##2. Product owner can't or doesn't fulfill the role.
- The product owner says: "you should be able to figure this out."
- Real ownership requires constantly and actively participating the the definition and clarification of acceptance criteria, requirements, and product needs.

##3. Scrum masters act like our protective parents.
- The desire to control, or drive can take over and dominate the process.
- Legacy attitudes of command and control butt up against the need remove impediments and coach a team to be high performing; Druckman said:

> If you are a really good scrum master you will work yourself out of a job.

##4. Stakeholder problems.
- "Just this once." - An unspoken message that "my needs are more important, to the point where we can abandon discipline and process."
- Clinging to legacy modes of work delivery will delay the transformation and cause a slippery slope situation.

##5. Organizations that don't understand commitments.
- Negotiation arises when there is punishment for miss commitments. A culture of fear prevents realistic or real commitments.
- Commitments are one sided. A commitment must be a two sided agreement; if I commit to deliver the code to you in 5 days then you must also commit to deliver detailed requirements in 2 days.

##6. Organizations can't time box.
- Tasks can become more important than outcomes, focusing on the outcome can lead to creative solutions with a given amount of time.
- Gandalf said it best:

>  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.

##7. Teams can not inspect and adapt.
- Improvements are considered "more work" which is short sighted, whereas they might reduce work in the future.
- Complacency can arise when teams declare "we are already good." Strive to always make things more simple and efficient.

##8. Unbalanced agile toolkit distribution.
- The unspoken message is "who's important? these are the people that need the tools."
- Adoption and coaching should happen across entire teams, or some will feel ignored or disenfranchised.

##9. Thinking agile is "something tech people do."
- Agile is not just for software engineers, it has been shown to work effectively across many industries.
- Each member of a team, not just developers, must embrace the methodology.

##10. Lack of understanding about the behaviors you are reinforcing.
- Cutting people slack all the time can promote a lack of discipline. Harsh punishments will promote conservative behavior that could hurt innovation.
- An attitude that "people won't know what to do unless you tell them" can undermine the self organization of a team.

##11. Not understanding what a trade-off is.
- Everything is a trade-off, to have one thing, you must give up another.
- Not everything is equal, and not everything is needed. Teams and management must understand that to require one thing may necessitate giving up something else: I can commit to deliver the code in 5 days, but with only 3 of the 4 features.

##12. Redefining what success looks like.
- The ideal should be a "low drama organization": people want to be there, it's generally quite, things just kinda get done.
- The days of crazy dead lines and long hours are gone, by rewarding a "hero" engineer who pulled an all-nighter, you are probably rewarding hacked together code and a lack of adequate planning.

If you were there I hope you enjoyed the talk as much as I did!
