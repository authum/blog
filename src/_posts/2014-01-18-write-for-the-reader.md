description: "Three things that get in the way of readers enjoying and consuming your content."
---


I've been reading a ton of blog posts lately while fleshing out my knowledge of design patterns, java, figuring out how to set up eclipse, and learning about computer architecture. I've also spent an average amount of time distracting myself with the hot links of my reddit feed: learning this or that about, you know, topics that in which I'm interested. 

None of this is really much of a new practice, perhaps the volumen has gone up, but regardless, the adventure has helped me formulate a hit list of 3 crimes most which blogs commit. And I must remedy them for myself and help others find salvation.

##1. Readers care about the content they read, or the answer they seek, and nothing else. 

- They don't care about other articles you recently wrote.
- They don't care about your exciting newsletter, or book.
- And they don't really care who you are. 

The proof is in the pudding. Let's look at my own stats. Recent figures gathered through mix panel show that out of 4000 people who read about halfway through my posts, less than 1% clicked on one of my recently written articles.

![Funnel of Article Reads and Other Articles Clicked](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s5/sh/6c6e20b0-e7d1-4432-a57c-c3a4c0cb3b66/41499a5736f98946f378ef63b34403a6/deep/0/Never-Stop-Building---Funnels---Mixpanel---Mobile-Analytics.png)

Readers only care about your content. Did you solve the problem they have? Have you enlightened them to some nuance of a current event? Did you teach them something?

No? Well, click. You're gone, and never will you be thought of again untill someone is googling for something and your content offers a response. 

No one thinks: "Oh gee, I have a question about topic X, I'll see if Joe Blogs has an article about that." No silly, they type the question into Google and pick the first article with a picture or the stack overflow reference.

I've removed the recent articles from the side bar of my blog; my topics are rather diverse anyway. If you really want to see what else I have written (I thank you), then check out the archive.

##2. If you have ads on your website, you are part of the problem.

Perhaps I'd be signing a different tune if I wasn't making, like, NO money from the ads I had on this blog, but don't get me wrong, I'd still feel like a dirty whore about it. I tried the ads as an experiment to see what the margins would be like. I also feel guilty and hipocrytical because I block all ads in my browser, so why would i subject my presious readers  to the same pointless shit. 

It is simply sinister and appauling to drive traffic to your site with some catchy blog title with the hopes they will "convert" and click on some random ad so you can make money. You're simply using psychology to cheat, derriving value not from your content but from your position as a shill for hire. 

Gosh, the number of absured huffington post, buzz feed, gawker, vile useless trash with titles like "10 things you can use to clean your ears" i have seen on terrible facebook recently makes me so sad about the state of society and intelectual discourse. 

The psychology works, Hell, I'd click that link. what, in the world, ARE people cleaning thier ears with? Yet it is empty, it makes us just a mass of flesh, constantly regugitating the feed to the benifit of the advertisers. Be strong and don't be a part of it.

As you may see there are no longer ads on this site. I'm sorry, and if you remember clicking on one of them, and contact me, I'll send you some bitcoin or personally research alternatives to the product you clicked on.

##3. Hey guess what genious? Monitors are wider than a roll of toilet paper?

And with all the shit cluttering up your screen space, I'll need the roll to clean it up. How many blogs have a 3/4 or 2/3 column of text, with a bunch of adds and pointless clickbait links on the side, some side notes scattered about, and that whole mess is then centered in a 900px center bar?

Here is one:

What is this nonsense? I'm not that old but on my Air I'll still zoom in a bit to expand the article to full screen and read it in peace. Your number one concern should be about delivering high quality content in an easy to consume format to the end user. 

Medium is doing a good job of this, some how both that site and my own arrived at the large image header independently.  Zen Habbits also does a good job of this and Leo writes a bunch about his web design decisions. Finaly, Readability lets you reload the article with all of this cruft removed.

![Readability applied to the same article from above.](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s5/sh/bc47b128-5a42-4fc1-a6c5-18fa4bc324c6/0cb0914f935786e797d2e820d1c97d65/deep/0/Rosetta-comet-chaser-set-to-wake-up-on-Monday-after-three-years'-sleep---www.theguardian.com.png)

Your homework: Expand your articles to fill the screen, use good legible and larger type. 


###Eating My Own Medicine

By killing adds and the side bar, I have all this clean room! Notice that I've expanded the default grid to fill the page. I hope its more joyful to read even this rant!

Please, I'm begging you, make the internet a place of beuty not a bunch of hooker flyers and pizza delivery coupons tacked on to news bites. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.
