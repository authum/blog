Last year I was involved as the technical lead of a startup called LoyalCurve which has since folded. It was a very educational and fun experience, and some of the lessons learned are worth sharing. Our then intern, Sal Briggman, had these thoughts on the subject (the bolds are mine):

> For me, LoyalCurve was an exciting and rewarding journey from day one. It was the exact startup experience that I was looking for and am proud to say I feel more capable, more knowledgeable, and better connected than I was seven months ago. Before LoyalCurve, I had 0 connections on LinkedIn and twitter, never really experienced door to door sales, and had a large fear of interpersonal communications in a sales context. In addition, I had never really talked with people in the US who were actually pursuing startups and working day and night to get products to market.

> Since then, I have expanded my LinkedIn network to 500+ individuals, have 350 followers of my blog CrowdCrux, and am working every day on my first real startup (Hireworx), which has customers. In addition, I am over my fears of interpersonal sales. I feel grateful for all the opportunities that were extended to me ranging from attending networking events to having my product ideas valued and considered. More than anything, I enjoyed the collaborative yet independent atmosphere and the people I was working with.

> I also learned a tremendous amount about startups in general. I believe we were very good about:
>
1. Acquiring teammates.
2. Creating culture in the company.
3. Direct sales in a friendly non-invasive way.
4. Focusing on the present and not letting people get distracted by the future.
5. Learning from the pilot group.
6. Asking our mentor and others to extend industry introductions.

> At the same time, I think we were lacking in some areas. First, before we used any investor money, we **should have taken time to validate the assumptions we made about the market** and build the product. We did a good job in the beginning validating our assumptions with the focus groups, but we never actually got the product into the market, which is when the real learning occurs in my opinion.

> Once the minimum viable product was created and we began getting feedback from the marketplace, we would adjust accordingly. Once we had a minimum viable product that got good industry feedback and we recorded the actions we took to market it and get the first few users on board, I think then [our CEO] should have quit his job and should have begun using investor capital to scale the product a bit. At this point, we would know:
>
1. Our product has its first customer
2. The minimum viable product is built
3. Our initial hypothesis is validated.

> This way it would have been much less risky so that we could try a bunch of things until we found a good initial product-market fit (and we knew the client would pay) and then began chugging away full time.

> Hindsight is always 20 20, but I think our biggest two mistakes were:
>
> **Product**
>
> Our product was behind schedule, we kept changing the vision of the product, and the changes we made in the vision for the product weren't coming from direct customer behavior but individuals we had talked with and advice from others.

> **Human Resources**
>
> [Our CEO] quit his job too early and began using investor money too quickly (because he had quit his job). He should have done this once we had a minimum viable product that was validated by the market place meaning that the client was willing to pay, the restaurant attendees used it, and and the client was happy with the results. True, this would be a slower process, but less risky. At this point, our focus should have been scaling and building in extra key features/improving the user experience.

> Overall, it was an incredible experience and I learned more than most of my paid internships. I would do it again in a heart beat, which is why I've caught the startup bug and am working on my own.
