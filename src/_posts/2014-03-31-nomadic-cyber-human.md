The Internet seemed a little light on self-aggrandizing, psudo-advertisements bragging about the author's lifestyle and packing list (see [this](http://davidturnbull.com/packing-list-2013/), [this](http://www.tropicalmba.com/digital-nomad-packing-list-2014-living-since-2008-with-2-bags/), [this](http://hackthesystem.com/blog/the-2013-digital-nomad-packing-list/), [this](http://valerieandgriffin.com/the-ultimate-digital-nomad-packing-list/) and [this](http://zenhabits.net/the-beginners-guide-to-minimalist-travel/) for a few examples), so I decided to add one more.

Speaking of "light," I think packing light great. Not only is it fun to solve the puzzle of "what do I really need?" but the reduction in effort, stress, and "schlep" is always welcome when bouncing around the world.

I'm about to embark on a few weeks of living as a nomadic cyber human. The goal is to see the lower half of Argentina, all the while delivering on my consulting work. I've assembled a kit of gear that seems appropriate to support me through this adventure. While I've included the whole list at the end of the post, here are some topics I'd like to highlight. Hopefully this list will help inspire your own, everyone's needs are slightly different.

##Connectivity is Key
The most important thing needed to make this work is that I must access the great interwebs. As such I have a bevy of connectivity devices: Laptop WIFI, Ethernet adapters, a 3G modem on one cellular network, and an iPhone on another cellular network. This should be plenty to fill the gaps between hotel/hostel/airbnb internet.

Power is also critical to long-term, remote work, and so I borrowed the Hyperjuice power pack from my [military spec computer case project]({{site.url}}/mil-spec-mac) to ensure I have a good full day of charge.

##Did you wear that yesterday?
Yeah, I did, actually for the last few weeks. I decided to bring a single pair of pants, two shirts, two undies (one doubles as a bathing suit), two pairs of socks, and some warm layers. I can wear the pairs in alternate and wash one and let it dry overnight.

The fact is, I'm traveling, not putting on a fashion show, and also, who the fuck cares? So often you end up wearing less than you packed anyway. It is the utility that is really important, especially when you are going from town to town all the time, and not lounging poolside at a resort (then I might bring a little more fancy.)

I'd like to eventually upgrade some of the clothing to more high-tech, science-fabric alternatives. Apparently wool underwear is the new hotness because it is anti-microbial. Well for now I'll just have to settle for good old cotton and cow skin.

##Staying Fresh
Even though I'm not going to have a very broad wardrobe, I do plan on always being fresh as a daisy. You'll note I've spent some precious space on various miniaturized versions of toiletries. This will ensure I make it to the next camp and ensure that I look like a somewhat civilized human being when I emerge from my coding nest to sip wine in the Rio Negro.

It seems to me that if you are fresh you are more confident, and if you are more confident you can handle adversity better. And on an extended trip in a foreign land, handling adversity is you full time job.

##Packing List
Here is a run down of everything I'm bringing. I've removed brands because I'm not trying to be Uncrate. Post a comment if you want to know what something is. A few of the items I'm wearing and so they are not in the picture.
