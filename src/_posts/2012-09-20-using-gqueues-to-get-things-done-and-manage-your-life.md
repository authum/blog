I'm a big fan of [gQueues](https://www.gqueues.com/) as a light way way to set up a todo list system that has just enough configurability, but not too much required to get started. Some things I like about it:

- Quickly adding items using [natural language syntax](http://www.gqueues.com/help/quickAdd#syntax)
- Integrates seamlessly with [google calendar](http://www.gqueues.com/help/calendarIntegration)
- Has a nice [chrome extension](http://www.gqueues.com/help/chromeExtension) to clip websites

##A Simple GTD Setup
The purpose of this post is to share how I have set it up, which I hope will help you explore what works best for your personal workflow. I tend to bounce around between to-do list apps trying new things. But the following configuration has lasted me quite a while.

Here are my "queues":

###The Basics

- **Inbox** - Everything goes in there, its just like it sounds, a place for me to throw things, and sort through later.
- **Specific Projects Folder** - Here I create queues for any active projects I am working on. You will see how this is important soon. So for example, I might have a queue "Fix Sewing Machine" with tasks: *order gear*, *look up help guide*, *do the repair*. This folder also contains a **To-Do** project, which contains all generic one-offs I am working on.
- **Pending Projects Folder** - This is just the same as the above, but for projects I want to do or need planning, but I am not actively doing. Maybe I have "restore speedboat" that started out as an idea/todo and then became a pending project and I added some relevant tasks to it. Once I am ready to actively push the project toward completion, I'll move it into **Specific Projects**.
- **Lists** - Here you can see a few important catch all lists that group certain items:
    - **Reading** - Books, articles, or websites that I want to read.
    - **Someday** - A collection of random ideas, projects, and wants that I take a look at every so often. Things in here may wind up in **Pending Project**.
    - **Ticker** - Here are items that I don't want to worry about now, but that I will in the future, every item in here has to have a date. Specifically, this is where I put an idea for a hollowed costume dated a week or so before October 31.
    - **To Learn** - Similar to **Reading**, lets me collect topics that I want to learn so I stay on top of them.

###Smart Queues
The key to this set up is the "smart queues", which let you use some simple rules to help with your work flow, they can get pretty crazy, but simple is best:

- **Today** - This is easy, any item with a date of the current date will show up here. When things are running smoothly, it gives me a quick look at any hot items.
- **Next Actions** - Here is the classic [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) concept. This queue shows the top item from any of my **Specific Projects**, that way in one quick list I can see what is next to drive each project forward.
- **For Review** - Another GTD goodie, this shows any tasks that are "overdue" and in the **Ticker** queue. So during my review I might see *Send birthday card to cousin bill* and I would know to move that to my **To-Do** queue.

Well there you have it. I encourage you to give this set up a shot and let me know if you found any pain points. I have also been experimenting with [Trello](https://trello.com) and will post soon about how I have that set up.
