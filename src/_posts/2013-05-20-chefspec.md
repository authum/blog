*This is the fifth part of a [series on the development of Chef Broiler Plate]({{ site.url }}/blog/categories/chef-broiler-plate/) in which we go over setting up a robust, TDD framework for Chef cookbook development.*

##Shameless Self Promotion
With this post, I'd like to announce that the companion book, [The Chef Survival Guide](https://leanpub.com/chef-survival-guide) has been published on Leanpub. Why not head over and pick it up to see the rest of this series and all future examples and updates!? With a minimum price of $9.99 you can get a condensed dose of Chef best practices, saving you untold hours of internet scouring and banging your head on the desk.

##Back to Business
[Previously]({{ site.url }}/chef-vagrant/) we finished our basic setup tasks and should now have a nicely set up development environment with Knife, Vagrant, a Rake build system, with continuous integration with Travis. All this is well and good, but the fun part of building this framework is working through a sample cookbook, in a clean, test driven fashion.

To give you an idea of what's coming up, the testing tools we are going to use in this framework are:

- Chefspec
- Knife cookbook testing
- Foodcritic
- Minitest

Along the way we will need to flesh out the framework to support these various things in a continuously integrated and test driven way, but the best way to do it is to work a feature. Consider the business requirement:

    In order to let my developers know who's server this is
    As an Admin
    I want my company name in the message of the day.

Ok so we are going to build a little message of the day cookbook, it will feed off a data bag value, and when we ssh into our box, we should see something like:

    ####################################################
    #                                                  #
    #  This server is property of Never Stop Building  #
    #                                                  #
    ####################################################

But being true craftsman, we will start by using Chefspec to "spec" out the cookbook!

##Update your Gemfile
Add checfspec to your Gemfile:

```ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"

ruby '1.9.3'

gem 'rake', '10.0.4'
gem 'chef', '11.4.4'
gem "chefspec", "1.0.0"

group :development do
end
```

And of course do a `bundle update`.

##Automate Chefspec Cookbook Creation
According to the Chefspec documentation you can create a cookbook and then use another command to create the spec directory:

    knife cookbook create -o . my_new_cookbook
    knife cookbook create_specs -o . my_new_cookbook

*Two commands simply won't do*, and who knows how many other things I may want to do while creating a new cookbook. So let's build a rake task: `new_cookbook`

```ruby
desc "Creates a new cookbook."
task :new_cookbook, :name do |t, args|
  sh "bundle exec knife cookbook create #{args.name}"
  sh "bundle exec knife cookbook create_specs #{args.name}"
end
```

Pretty simple for now.

##Create Your Sample Cookbook (WOO!)

    rake new_cookbook motd

At this point we have a new blank cookbook. We can run the basic tests with

    rspec cookbooks

But that is lame… let's add a rake task for that and update our build task to use it:

```ruby
desc "Runs chefspec on all the cookbooks."
task :chefspec do
  sh "bundle exec rspec cookbooks"
end

##Make sure to add the below line to your build task:
Rake::Task[:chefspec].execute
```

Not too hard.

##Create a Failing Spec
Finally we can add the spec for the motd cookbook, in the `motd/spec/default_spec.rb` file:

```ruby
require 'chefspec'

describe 'motd::default' do
  let (:chef_run) { ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new.converge 'motd::default' }
  it 'should do create a motd file with the company name' do
    Chef::Recipe.any_instance.stub(:data_bag_item).with("global-properties", "company").and_return({"id" => "company", "name" => "Never Stop Building"})
    expect(chef_run).to create_file_with_content('/etc/motd.tail', 'This server is property of Never Stop Building')
  end
end
```

Running `rake build` should show us this now fails. Next we need to implement the cookbook.

##Make your Spec Pass
For the `recipes/default.rb` file:

```ruby
data_bag_item = data_bag_item('global-properties', 'company')

template "/etc/motd.tail" do
  source "motd.tail.erb"
  mode "0644"

  company_name = data_bag_item['name']
  filler = "#" * company_name.length
  space_filler = " " * company_name.length

  variables(
    :company_name => company_name,
    :filler => filler,
    :space_filler => space_filler
  )
  action :create
end
```

And the `templates/default/motd.tail.erb` file:

```ruby
##############################<%= @filler %>###
#                             <%= @space_filler %>  #
#  This server is property of <%= @company_name %>  #
#                             <%= @space_filler %>  #
##############################<%= @filler %>###
```

Awesome! We made a test driven Cookbook! And because our Travis file is already referencing the `build` task, when we push this code up our CI will run this test and verify our work.

##Coming up…
More testing to come, in the next post we will learn about using "Foodcritic" to test our cookbook code quality.
