Recently I was in the process of updating my various profiles/branding and I had a bit of writers block. So I took some common advice and just started typing. It appears I had quite a lot to say. What follows is a cleaned up version.

---

The idea of the resume is terrible garbage, I mean seriously, its the most contrived self aggrandizing, buzz word vomit that I have ever seen.

I just was looking over my latest one and I am surprised that that I was hired by anyone sensible, let alone a software company. It reads like a late night ad for exercise equipment. I was under the impression that engineers just don't put up with bullshit; but I guess the hiring process loves it. Well I don't agree with that. I'm not going to fall in line and puke on a bit of trumped up tree bark to get a job.

Resume.

CV.

Here are a list of things that make me valuable as a human being, actually really only valuable to you. Whoever is reading it is reading my spec sheet, seeing what kind of things they can plug me into; what kind of things they can plug into me. What is my dpi? What is my ppm, ccp, fps, mpg, hp? Well here is what I stand for, and it comes in leather:

> My name is Jason Fox and I build software. I give a *fuck* about everything I touch with my hands. I will **not** settle for anything less than high quality execution of craft. It is in my blood.
>
> I was born and raised in Washington, DC. I customized my own cars throughout high school. I won the science fair all four years. Potato cannon: 1200 feet distance. Trebuchet: 22 feet tall. Tesla coil: 1 million volts. Moonshine still: 190 proof. They *invented* an award to distinguish me and my partner in crime.
>
> I went to Rochester Institute of Technology to study mechanical engineering. I wanted to build race cars for a living. I joined the formula SAE team and, with a team of legendary people, built open wheel formula style cars from the ground up. Machining the parts. Welding. Designing. Class all day, work all night. Even the weekends. *My mom called the police because she couldn't find me*. We were in the shop all the time. I led the group that used the computer controlled mill to make some of the most critical parts on the car. I learned how to work under insane pressure and build something incredible.
>
> But business came calling. I took a quarter off to assess my path, my life, and what I wanted to do. I changed majors to business administration and finance. Before I did that it was necessary to take a few classes on a cruise ship while touring all of Southeast Asia. Semester at Sea brought me to: Hawaii, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan. That trip shaped my life. Travel humbles me, balances me, inspires me; it teaches things that will never be learned in an office, behind a desk, on on a screen.
>
> The plan was to be a hot shot on Wall Street. Upon returning I simply dominated at a discipline I had almost zero experience with. Accounting. Options. Futures. Strategy. I got an A in every single class save one. There is no shame in that B. It kept me hungry. I did so well that upon arriving late to one of my senior classes, a provost in full regalia was waiting to publicly invite me to join the Beta Gamma Sigma honor society.
>
> I took an internship at a forensic accounting firm. They hired me at the end before I even graduated. My job was to analyze financial statements to look for accounting irregularities that could mean people were doing shady things like at Enron, Worldcom, or MicroStrategy. In fact my company's research helped to expose all those disasters I just mentioned. I left RIT with a Minor: Mechanical Engineering, Major: Finance, and concentration in music history. I fenced, sailed, worked at a glue factory and a post office.
>
> Like fish my firm was acquired but a firm that was then itself acquired. All financial. At the time I was loving life, leaning new things every day and making money. I had a few sharp mentors that taught me how to code, how to read financial statements, and how to sell an idea both inside and outside a company. I programed in Perl and PHP and was the founding member on a small team that would prototype new ideas for research reports. We didn't know it then, but it was Lean Startup all the way. I also watched a small company splinter and be consumed by a bureaucratic cube farm. Layoffs, politics, jockeying, and gamesmanship. Hindsight is 20/20.
>
> Everyone was leaving, and soon it was my turn. I thought I had enough chops to get a "real" programming job; I must have said the right things to the right people because I was soon working for an educational company as a software engineer. What a breath of fresh air, now I was rocking; here is what a resume can not convey but prose can:
>
> I have been at this company for just over a year and a half. I have gone from barely knowing a thing about PHP to be described as one of the most skilled developers on the team. I won an innovation award. Chosen as a technical lead on a greenfield lean UX project and allowed to train an offshore team, on location, in Romania. I have no formal training in the following buzzwords: Agile, Lean, UX, TDD, BDD, Domain Driven Design, OOP, Dependency Injection, SCRUM, Kanban, Story Points, Burn-down, Unit Tests, Quality Assurance, Release Planning. However I have learned to use all of these skills to develop my craft from outrageously skilled and patient mentors.
>
> I owe my success to mentorship and my ceaseless desire to improve myself and everything I work with. I want to know how everything works, how to take it apart, put it back together. Build it. Break it. Improve it. When I listen to "you can't do that", or "that can't be done", or "that is too expensive" all I hear is weakness and a challenge. It is not a clichÃ© when it is the truth. I don't know everything, I barely know anything. But I do know for dead certain that I love to figure out *what I don't know* and *learn what I need* to to create something beautiful, something meticulous that fills others with joy whether it is an application used by students, the wiring of a motorcycle, or an eager apprentice. I will never stop building.
>
> Hmm, that sounds good on paper. But last time I was about to make a massive investment, I'd take it out for a test drive, bring it in for a look-see. Pop the hood. Inspect all the parts. Put it to work. See where the pain points are. See which buttons I need to push. Which buttons I can push. If I could get a job by writing a resume, I'd be an author. If certifications proved anything other than my ability to get certifications, I'd get them. Give me six months and something I want to do; I will not promise to exceed your expectations, but I will say that I have done so for at least the past 10 years of my life.

Building is what I love to do, in addition to software engineering my other passions include: customizing motorcycles, cooking, photography, design, architecture, and exploring the world. Most of these passions are cataloged on this blog where I have also built a [traditional resume](http://jasonrobertfox.com/cv).

That's a wrap.
